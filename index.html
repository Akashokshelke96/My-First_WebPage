            I found some good motorcyclist quotes and felt like sharing with you all. These are great for sharing on
            World Motorcycle Day that’s celebrated every year on 21st June

            “A motorcycle is like a drug but it doesn’t clog your arteries, impair your brain function, or send you to a
            rehabilitation centre. Plus, it’s completely legal (if you have a licence).” Yeah, that was my creation
            haha. <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderslist.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F08%2FDon.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderslist.com%2F10-most-funny-images%2F&amp;tbnid=5IysltTuGl6HqM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjhzvLz2Kb0AhWGjNgFHRk-CvkQMygNegUIARDJAQ..i&amp;docid=FVsxvpJKuQYOqM&amp;w=500&amp;h=399&amp;itg=1&amp;q=funny%20images&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhzvLz2Kb0AhWGjNgFHRk-CvkQMygNegUIARDJAQ"></a>

            Motorcycling is an amazing lifestyle that needs to be celebrated once in a while. One way to do this is
            through sharing one of these more popular motorcycle riding quotes:

        <ol>
            <li>
                “Doesn’t matter what you ride, give respect to get respect”- Anonymous
            </li>

            <li>“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery; Ride and live today”- Anonymous</li>

            <li>“If you want to be happy for a day, drink.</li>
            If you want to be happy for a year, marry.
            If you want to be happy for a lifetime, ride a motorcycle.”- Anonymous

            <li> “You don’t stop riding when you get old, you get old when you stop riding.”- Anonymous</li>

            <li>“Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass: it’s about learning how to ride in the rain!”-
                Anonymous
            </li>
            <li> “A bike on the road is worth two in the shed.”- Anonymous</li>

            <li>“You are on your own. You are not protected by two tons of steel, rubber, foam padding and safety glass.
                Neither are you steering two tons of guided missile toward other cars, people and property. If you are
                prepared to accept the responsibility of your own actions, then motorcycling can be both safe and
                thrilling. Riding is an art as well as a craft and no amount of explanation can take the place of
                experience.
            </li>
    </ol>

            First sub-category of road racing is pretty well known, I expect you heard about it before. It’s named Motorcycle Grand Prix, or MotoGP. We will cover this category today. Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix is probably the most popular type of motorcycle racing and it consists of three distinct classes: Moto2, MotoGP and 125cc.
<br>
            Grand prix bikes are specifically customized racing machines, they are not legal in the streets, and you can’t buy one either.
<br>
            MotoGP is the oldest of all motor-sports World Championships – first competition been held in far 1949. Traditionally, there were several races for various classes of motorcycles. Classes were based on the engine size, and 2 of them were designed for sidecars. They were: 50cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, and 500cc.

                But today we are going to cover just the first part of this humongous topic: Motorcycle Grand Prix. Start your engines and let’s roll!

                So what is road racing? Road racing is the type of racing that takes place on the tarmac (only) – these will be specially designed racing circuits or just closed public roads.
